# WS-GPLVM: Weighted Sum Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model

Welcome to the code for WS-GPLVM, an implementation of the Weighted Sum Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model. This tool was designed to alow the GPLVM to be used to answer some common problems in Machine Learning.

## Getting Started

Before running into the code, please ensure you have the proper environment set up:

### Prerequisites

- **Python Version**: This implementation is compatible with Python 3.11.5. Please make sure you have this version installed to avoid compatibility issues.

### Installation

- **Dependencies**: To install all required dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Once you've set up your environment, you're ready to start using WS-GPLVM:

- **Running Examples**: Explore how to use the model by running the example scripts located in the `examples` folder.
- **Comparison Methods**: If you're interested in benchmarking or comparing performance, the necessary code is available in the `comparison_methods` folder.

## Results 

You can find the output of our experiments in the `results` folder. The scripts in `results/analysis` can be used to generate the plots and tables found in the paper.


##Â Data Splits 

Only one split has been left for each experiment to reduce repository size
